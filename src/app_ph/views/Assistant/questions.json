It was my first time working in a startup environment, where I found I was able to make individual contributions at a bigger scale. Specifically, one project I worked on involved building a system for stitching photographs taken by drones together to make a map of the world, and deploying that service to the cloud. The more important takeaways from this internship, aside from technical skills, were helping me realize that I needed to start prioritizing my ability to work in a team more and build confidence in my communications and understanding of teams, in addition to just the technical skills.
